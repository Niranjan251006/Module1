# Ex 1:Datatypes-Boolean Expression Evaluation in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that evaluates and prints the results of boolean and arithmetic expressions involving `True` and `False`.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Set variable `a` to the result of the expression `0 == True`.
2. Set variable `b` to the result of the expression `False == False`.
3. Set variable `c` to the result of the expression `True + True`.
4. Set variable `d` to the result of the expression `False + 9`.
5. Print the value of `a` with the label "a is".
6. Print the value of `b` with the label "b is".
7. Print the value of `c` with the label "c:".
8. Print the value of `d` with the label "d:".

```
a = (False == True)
b = (False== 0)
c = False + True
d = False + 5
print("a is",a)
print("b is",b)
print("c:",c)
print("d:",d)
```

## Output
![438091189-4e1aea27-61fc-40e3-8f69-7c83009d3c48](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f5e4d6d-829a-4bbd-a215-41b220412526)

## Result
Thus,the PPython program that evaluates and prints the results of boolean and arithmetic expressions involving True and False is created successfully.
